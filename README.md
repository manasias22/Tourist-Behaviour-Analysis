# CSL7012_Big Data Analytics Lab
## Lab Objectives: Students will be able to

1.Solve Big Data problems using Map Reduce Technique and apply to various algorithms.

2.Identify various types of NoSQL databases and execute NOSQL commands

3.Understand implementation of various analytic techniques using Hive/PIG/R/Tableau, etc.

4.Apply streaming analytics to real time applications.

## Lab Outcomes:
1.To interpret business models and scientific computing paradigms, and apply software tools for big data analytics.

2.To implement algorithms that uses Map Reduce to apply on structured and unstructured data

3.To perform hands-on NoSql databases such as Cassandra, HadoopHbase, MongoDB, etc.

4.To implement various data streams algorithms.

5.To develop and analyze the social network graphs with data visualization techniques.
